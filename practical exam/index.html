                We know that during COVID-19, a lot <br>
                of folks around the city and <br>
                state are feeling uneasy about the <br>
                future - we're not sure what <br>
                the future holds either.
                That said: we know that we love making <br>
                sure you have the gear you <br>
                need for your adventures, and we're <br>
                going to keep doing that - with our team - <br>
                until the city tells us we can't <br>
                But as long as folks like <br>
                yourself support small businesses around the <br>
                city, then we'll be here â€” every <br>
                day, making sure your orders arrive on time.
